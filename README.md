# Serverless scheduler

A completely serverless, high-precision scheduler for ad hoc jobs.

## Usage

Send a POST request the to scheduler endpoint with at least the following payload:

```js
{
  "endpoint": "http://example.com/my-webhook",
  "scheduleAt": "2021-08-21T22:00:00.000+0200"
}
```

The scheduler will make a HTTP request to the defined endpoint soon after the timestamp.

## Architecture

A combination of DynamoDBs TTL and SQS' Message Delays is used to reach a precision close to seconds while maintaining a serverless approach that truly scales.

## Architecture

Job details are stored in DynamoDB while the scheduling is managed by a combination of Eventbridge schedules and SQS' Message Delays to reach a precision close to 1 second while maintaining a serverless approach that truly scales.
